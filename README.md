# Experience
### Current Work
  - Architecting an adaptable operating system platform for versatile product integration. (Python, C/C++, XML, JSON, CentOS, Rocky Linux 8, Systemd Services).
  - Developed High Availability(Active Passive) of server nodes on Rocky Linux. (VMware Workstation, KVM, pacemaker, drbd)
  - Driven a core platform development utilizing Rest API, SQL, microservices, and container deployment. (SprintBoot, C++, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL, Azure Platform)
  - Developed platform services in Java Spring boot, which communicates with RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL for data, and blob Storage for file storage.

### Past Experience 1
  - Developed Python application for HPE StoreEasy products, synchronizing messages from Kafka and RabbitMQ. (Python, RabbitMQ, Kafka)
  - Implemented a universal event system and conducted core dump and crash analysis on HPE Store Virtual and HPE 3PAR. (C++, callback, gdb)

### Past Experience 2
  - Developed a server driver update tool and a utility for automated firmware updates (BMC, BIOS, Controllers) for Cisco UCSM servers. (C/C++, Python, IPMItool, ISO)
  - Conducted debugging and resolved bugs within these utilities, and implemented additions to storage firmware. (gdb, valgrind)
  - Installing a new card and controller into the system and ensuring successful identification by Host OS. (squashfs, sgutils, nvme-cli)

### Past Experience 3
  - Developed C/C++ tools for Seagate servers, scripted multi-platform packages, and automated builds with Python. (C/C++, Python, rpm, dpkg, rpmbuild, msi)
  - Established GIT and Jenkins for automation, troubleshooted issues, and analyzed core dumps for Hybrid NAS boxes. (gdb, git, valgrind)
  - Utilized toolchains for cross-compilation of open-source packages. (make)

# Interests and Learning
